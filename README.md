# hello-world
my first github repo
This is just a part of my introduction to the world of coding. I have a long background in construction and I have wanted to make a big change to my career trajectory and learn a fun and creative new skill in the process. I am learning with some fantastic resources like Free Code Camp, Mozilla Developer Network, Some apps like SoloLearn, Py and Dcoder and technical references like the BaseCS series by Vaidehi Joshi.
I am really excited to learn this awesome new skill and I cant wait to build great things!
